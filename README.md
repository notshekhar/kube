# digg

A fast **Kubernetes TUI** for your terminal — browse pods, deployments,
services, nodes and more; switch namespaces and contexts; view YAML, describe,
and logs. Built in Bun on [`@earendil-works/pi-tui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-tui)
(the renderer behind pi).

It wraps your local `kubectl`, so every auth method (client certs, tokens, and
exec plugins like aws/gcp/oidc) works out of the box. **kubectl must be on your
PATH.**

## Install

Prebuilt binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notshekhar/digg/main/install.sh | bash
```

From source:

```bash
bun install
bun ./src/cli.ts        # run it
bun build-bin.ts        # standalone binary in dist/bin/<target>/digg
```

Update with `digg update`. Uninstall with `DIGG_UNINSTALL=1 curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash`.

## Usage

```bash
digg            # launch the cluster browser
digg update     # update to the latest version
digg version    # print the version
```

| `g` / `G`      | top / bottom          |
| `:`            | switch resource kind  |
| `n`            | switch namespace      |
| `c`            | switch context        |
| `/`            | filter by name        |
| `enter`        | open detail dashboard |
| `y`            | view YAML             |
| `d`            | describe              |

| `ctrl+c`       | quit                  |

The list auto-refreshes every few seconds. Mouse wheel scrolls everywhere.

### Detail dashboard

Press `enter` on a deployment (or statefulset / daemonset / job) to drill in,
Lens/Aptakube style:

- a summary (replicas, strategy, images, age),
- its live **pods with CPU / memory** (`kubectl top`, auto-refreshing),
- and from there: `y` YAML, `d` describe, `l` logs of the selected pod,
  `p` to open a pod, `esc` to go back.

`enter` on a pod shows its containers and pod-level metrics. Logs stream live
(`kubectl logs -f`) and auto-follow the tail; `f` toggles follow, `G` jumps to
live.

## Resources

Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Services, Ingresses, ConfigMaps,
Secrets, Jobs, CronJobs, Nodes, Namespaces, and PVCs. Press `:` to switch.
